# Error Analysis and Tracking

## Fixed Issues

### 1. YouTube Iframe Loading and Sizing ✅
**Status:** Fixed
**Changes Made:**
1. Updated CSS with proper aspect ratio handling and scaling
2. Implemented YouTube IFrame API for better control
3. Added proper error handling and loading states
4. Fixed mobile playback issues with proper parameters

**Verification Needed:**
- [ ] Test on different mobile devices
- [ ] Verify smooth playback
- [ ] Check memory usage with multiple videos
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup on navigation

### 2. YouTube Player State Management ✅
**Status:** Fixed
**Stack Trace:**
- UI: explore.js → createPlayer() → YT.Player events
- Issue: Player state management and error recovery not robust enough

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Insufficient error handling in player events
2. No retry mechanism for failed video loads
3. Memory leaks from improper player cleanup
4. Race conditions in player state transitions
5. Missing handling for edge cases (UNSTARTED state)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Tracks attempts per video
   - Maximum 3 retries
   - Proper cleanup after max retries
2. Enhanced error handling
   - Try/catch blocks around all player operations
   - Improved error logging with video IDs
   - Proper cleanup on errors
3. Improved player management
   - Added cleanupPlayer function
   - Better state tracking
   - Proper resource cleanup
4. Memory management
   - Better cleanup of resources
   - Reset of retry attempts
   - Proper player destruction

**Verification Needed:**
- [ ] Test retry mechanism with problematic videos
- [ ] Verify memory usage over time
- [ ] Check error recovery in different network conditions
- [ ] Test multiple video transitions
- [ ] Verify cleanup on page navigation

## Current Issues

### 3. Video Loading Performance
**Stack Trace:**
- UI: Explore.razor → LoadMoreItems() → YouTube Embed
- Issue: Videos may not preload properly, causing janky scrolling

**Root Cause:**
1. No proper lazy loading implementation
2. YouTube iframes loading all at once
3. Missing optimization for mobile data usage

**Minimal Fix:**
1. Implement intersection observer for iframe loading
2. Add loading state management
3. Only load videos when they're about to come into view

### 4. Scroll Snap Behavior
**Stack Trace:**
- UI: Explore.razor → tiktok-feed div
- Issue: Scroll snapping not as smooth as TikTok

**Root Cause:**
1. CSS scroll-snap-type implementation needs tuning
2. Missing touch event handling for smooth swipe gestures
3. Potential performance issues with too many iframes

**Minimal Fix:**
1. Update scroll snap CSS:
```css
.tiktok-feed {
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

.video-container {
    scroll-snap-align: start;
    scroll-snap-stop: always;
}
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Implement fix for Issue #1 (YouTube iframe sizing)~~
2. ✅ ~~Implement fix for Issue #2 (Player state management)~~
3. Test Issue #2 fixes thoroughly
4. Move to Issue #3 (Video Loading) once #2 is confirmed working
5. Document any new issues discovered during testing

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Mobile portrait view (iPhone, Android)
- [ ] Mobile landscape view
- [ ] Tablet view
- [ ] Desktop view
- [ ] Different network conditions (4G, 3G, etc.)
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Multiple video transitions
- [ ] Page navigation cleanup

# Video Scaling Issues

## WebView Scaling Problem
**Issue**: WebView content shows black bars and incorrect scaling

**Root Cause**:
1. MAUI WebView CSS injection conflicts with web app's native video scaling
2. Web app already has proper video scaling CSS for different aspect ratios
3. Multiple scaling approaches fighting each other:
   - MAUI WebView container scaling
   - Injected CSS scaling
   - Web app's native scaling

**Solution**:
1. Remove CSS injection from MAUI
2. Let web app handle its own scaling
3. Focus on making WebView container fill available space without forcing dimensions
